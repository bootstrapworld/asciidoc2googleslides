# asciidoc2googleslides
Generate Google Slides from AsciiDoc

This is based on [md2googleslides](https://github.com/googleworkspace/md2googleslides), but with several notable differences:

- The markdown-it library has been replaced with asciidoctor.js, allowing the slides to be written using AsciiDoc
- We plan to extend the library with additional functionality, beyond what is available in md2googleslides
